## Voice & Tone Examples

### README.md Opening
```markdown
# Cheeky üçë

**A cheeky little internet radio for your Raspberry Pi**

Look, we know the name is a bit silly. But hear us out - Cheeky makes 
setting up a Raspberry Pi internet radio as easy as... well, pie.

Flash an SD card, boot your Pi, and you're listening to 100,000+ radio 
stations via TuneIn within 2 minutes. Control everything from a slick 
web interface, pair your Bluetooth speaker without touching SSH, and 
never take radio too seriously again.

Don't have a Pi yet? No worries - test it in QEMU first. We're cheeky, 
not irresponsible.
```

### Error Messages
```python
# Instead of boring errors:
"Error: Bluetooth device not found"

# Cheeky errors:
"üçë Well this is awkward... Can't find that Bluetooth speaker. 
Is it turned on? Playing hide and seek? Ghosting you?"

# But still helpful:
"Check: 1) Speaker is powered on, 2) Within range, 3) Not paired elsewhere"
```

### Installation Instructions
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Download** - Grab the right image for your Pi (we have all the flavors)
2. **Flash** - Use Raspberry Pi Imager (or get cheeky with `dd`)
3. **Boot** - Pop that SD card in and power up
4. **Party** - Visit http://raspberrypi.local:6680 and start jamming

Easy as pie. Or should we say... easy as *cheek*? 

(We'll stop now.)
```

### Commit Messages
```bash
# Professional but personality shows through
git commit -m "feat: add Bluetooth auto-reconnect (stop playing hard to get)"
git commit -m "fix: station search now finds 'BBC' instead of just 'B' (we were being too literal)"
git commit -m "docs: clarify WiFi setup (because asking politely works better than shouting)"
```

### GitHub Issue Templates
```markdown
## üêõ Bug Report

**What's being cheeky?**
Describe what went wrong. Cheeky is supposed to work, not be *too* cheeky.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Help us be less cheeky by showing us how to recreate the issue.

**Expected behavior:**
What should happen in a perfect, non-cheeky world?

**Screenshots:**
A picture's worth a thousand cheeky words.

```

## Conference & Presentation Guidelines

### Slide Title Examples
- "Cheeky: Taking the Pain Out of Pi Radio"
- "Getting Cheeky with Raspberry Pi Audio"
- "How Cheeky Went from Joke to 10k Downloads"

### Elevator Pitch
*"Cheeky is an open-source Raspberry Pi internet radio with a silly name but serious functionality. Flash an image, boot your Pi, and you're listening to 100,000+ TuneIn stations in 2 minutes. Web interface, Bluetooth audio, works on any Pi model. We made the name memorable so you'd remember how easy it is."*

### Handling Questions About the Name
**Q:** "Why is it called Cheeky?"

**A:** "It's British slang for playful or impudent - we wanted to signal that this project doesn't take itself too seriously. Radio should be fun! Plus, it's memorable. You'll remember 'Cheeky' way easier than 'RaspberryPi-Internet-Radio-System-v2.' Also, yes, the double meaning is intentional. We're self-aware."

really well! 100k+ TuneIn stations, web interface, Bluetooth control, 
QEMU testing without hardware. MIT licensed. Flash and go in 2 minutes.

### Hacker News
```
Title: "Cheeky ‚Äì Open-source Raspberry Pi internet radio (silly name, serious project)"

Comment: "Author here. Before you ask - yes, I know the name is ridiculous. 
That's intentional. I wanted something memorable that would signal 'this 
project doesn't take itself too seriously.'

The actual project is quite solid: DietPi-based, FastAPI backend, automated 
builds for all Pi models, QEMU testing, full Bluetooth management via web UI. 
MIT licensed.

Happy to answer questions!"
