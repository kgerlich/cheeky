## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cheeky-radio/cheeky.git
cd cheeky

# Install dependencies
pip install -r config/bluetooth-web-manager/requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/  # When tests are added

# Test in QEMU
cd qemu/linux
./start-qemu.sh
```

### Project Structure

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and file organization.

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints where possible
- Format with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
- Check style with [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)

```python
# Example
async def get_devices() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get all paired Bluetooth devices."""
    devices = []
    # Implementation
    return devices
```

### JavaScript/HTML/CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Alpine.js for interactivity (lightweight, no build step)
- Semantic HTML5
- Mobile-first responsive design

```html
<!-- Example -->
<div x-data="{ open: false }">
  <button @click="open = !open" class="px-4 py-2 bg-pink-500 rounded">
    Toggle
  </button>
</div>
```

### Bash

- Use `set -e` to exit on error
- Quote variables: `"$var"` not `$var`
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

DEVICE_MAC="$1"
if [ -z "$DEVICE_MAC" ]; then
    echo "Error: MAC address required"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages following this format:

```
Short description (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW.

Fixes #123
Relates to #456
```

Examples:
- ‚úì `Add WiFi configuration guide`
- ‚úì `Fix Bluetooth reconnect timeout issue`
- ‚úì `Update Mopidy version to v3.4.0`
- ‚úó `fixed stuff` (too vague)
- ‚úó `Changed mopidy.conf line 45` (too specific)
